## About Merlin-KV

Merlin-KV is a part of NVIDIA Merlin and provides hierarchical key-value storage to meet RecSys requirements.

The key capability of Merlin-KV is to store key-value (feature-embedding) on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) of GPUs and in host memory.

You can also use the library for generic key-value storage.

## Benefits of Merlin-KV

When building large recommender systems, machine learning (ML) engineers face the following challenges:

- GPUs are needed, but HBM on a single GPU is too small for the large DLRMs that scale to several terabytes.
- Improving communication performance is getting more difficult in larger and larger CPU clusters.
- It is difficult to efficiently control consumption growth of limited HBM with customized strategies.
- Most generic key-value libraries provide low HBM and host memory utilization.

Merlin-KV alleviates these challenges and helps the machine learning engineers in RecSys with the following benefits:

- Supports training large RecSys models on **HBM and host memory** at the same time.
- Provides better performance by **full bypassing CPUs** and reducing the communication workload.
- Implements table-size restraint strategies that are based on **LRU or customized strategies**.
  The strategies are implemented by CUDA kernels.
- Operates at a high working-status load factor that is close to 1.0.

Merlin-KV makes NVIDIA GPUs more suitable for training large and super-large models of ***search, recommendations, and advertising***.
The library simplifies the common challenges to building, evaluating, and serving sophisticated recommenders models.

## API Documentation

The main classes and structs are below, and it's recommended to read the comments in the source code directly:

- [`class HashTable`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/merlin-kv/blob/master/include/merlin_hashtable.cuh#L101)
- [`class EvictStrategy`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/merlin-kv/blob/master/include/merlin_hashtable.cuh#L106)
- [`struct HashTableOptions`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/merlin-kv/blob/master/include/merlin_hashtable.cuh#L34)

For regular API doc, please refer to [API Docs](https://nvidia-merlin.github.io/merlin-kv/master/api/index.html)

## Usage restrictions

- The `key_type` and `meta_type` must be `uint64_t`.

## Contributors

Merlin-KV is co-maintianed by [NVIDIA Merlin Team](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin) and NVIDIA product end-users,
and also open for public contributions, bug fixes, and documentation. [[Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)]

## How to build

Basically, Merlin-KV is a headers only library, the commands below only create binaries for benchmark and unit testing.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/merlin-kv.git
cd merlin-kv && mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Dsm=80 .. && make -j

// for Benchmark
./merlin_hashtable_benchmark

// for Unit Test
./merlin_hashtable_test
```

Your environment must meet the following requirements:

- CUDA version >= 11.2
- NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 8.0, 8.6, 8.7 or 9.0


## Benchmark

* GPU: 1 x NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB: 8.0
* Key Type = uint64_t
* Value Type = float32 * {dim}
* Key-Values per OP = 1,048,576
* ***Throughput Unit: Billion-KV/second***
