# Merlin-KV: A generic Key-Value library for RecSys
-----------------
[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](docs/api_docs/)

# What's the Merlin-KV?
[Merlin-KV](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/merlin-kv) is an open source library of NVIDIA Merlin.

- Merlin-KV is a generic Key-Value library designed with full considerations of RecSys requirements.
- Storing the key-value (feature-embedding) on both of the HBM and Host memory (SSD/NVMe is coming soon)
- Can also be used as a generic Key-Value storage

# Benefits

When building large recommender systems, machine learning (ML) engineers have been faced with the following challenges:

- GPUs are needed, but HBM on a single GPU is too small for the large DLRMs with several Tera Bytes
- Improving communication performance is getting harder in larger and larger CPU clusters
- Difficult to efficiently control consumption growth of limited HBM with customized strategies
- Low HBM/HMEM utilization when using the generic Key-Value library

Merlin-KV alleviates these challenges and helps the machine learning (ML) engineers in RecSys:

- Training the large RecSys models on HBM and Host memory at the same time
- Better performance by CPUs fully bypass and less communication workload
- Model size restraint strategies based on timestamp or occurrences, implemented by CUDA kernels and customizable
- High working status load factor which is close to 1.0

Merlin-KV makes NVIDIA GPUs more suitable for training large and super-large models of **Search, Recommendations, and Advertising** and 
makes building, evaluating, and serving sophisticated recommenders models easy.

## How to build

Basically, Merlin-KV is a headers only library, the commands below only create binaries for benchmark and unit testing.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/merlin-kv.git
cd merlin-kv && mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSM=80 .. && make -j

// for Benchmark
./merlin_hashtable_benchmark

// for Unit Test
./merlin_hashtable_test
```


## Benchmark

* Key Type = uint64_t
* Value Type = float32 * dim
* Key-Values per OP = 1,048,576
* ***Throughput Unit: Billion-KV/second***
