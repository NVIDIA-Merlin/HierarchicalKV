# Building Documentation

This is the API doc for Merlin-HKVS.


## View docs web page by opening HTML in browser:

First navigate `cd ./html/` and then run the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server
```
Then, navigate a web browser to the IP address or hostname of the host machine at port 8000:

```
https://<host IP-Address>:8000
```
Now you can check if your docs edits formatted correctly, and read well.
