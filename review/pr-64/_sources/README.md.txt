## About HierarchicalKV

HierarchicalKV is a part of NVIDIA Merlin and provides hierarchical key-value storage to meet RecSys requirements.

The key capability of HierarchicalKV is to store key-value (feature-embedding) on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) of GPUs and in host memory.

You can also use the library for generic key-value storage.

## Benefits of HierarchicalKV

When building large recommender systems, machine learning (ML) engineers face the following challenges:

- GPUs are needed, but HBM on a single GPU is too small for the large DLRMs that scale to several terabytes.
- Improving communication performance is getting more difficult in larger and larger CPU clusters.
- It is difficult to efficiently control consumption growth of limited HBM with customized strategies.
- Most generic key-value libraries provide low HBM and host memory utilization.

HierarchicalKV alleviates these challenges and helps the machine learning engineers in RecSys with the following benefits:

- Supports training large RecSys models on **HBM and host memory** at the same time.
- Provides better performance by **full bypassing CPUs** and reducing the communication workload.
- Implements table-size restraint strategies that are based on **LRU or customized strategies**.
  The strategies are implemented by CUDA kernels.
- Operates at a high working-status load factor that is close to 1.0.

HierarchicalKV makes NVIDIA GPUs more suitable for training large and super-large models of ***search, recommendations, and advertising***.
The library simplifies the common challenges to building, evaluating, and serving sophisticated recommenders models.

## API Documentation

The main classes and structs are below, and it's recommended to read the comments in the source code directly:

- [`class HashTable`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/HierarchicalKV/blob/master/include/merlin_hashtable.cuh#L101)
- [`class EvictStrategy`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/HierarchicalKV/blob/master/include/merlin_hashtable.cuh#L106)
- [`struct HashTableOptions`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/HierarchicalKV/blob/master/include/merlin_hashtable.cuh#L34)
- [`Struct HashTable::Vector`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/HierarchicalKV/blob/master/include/merlin_hashtable.cuh#L106)

For regular API doc, please refer to [API Docs](https://nvidia-merlin.github.io/HierarchicalKV/master/api/index.html)

## Usage restrictions

- The `key_type` and `meta_type` must be `uint64_t`.
- The keys of `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` and `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE` are reserved for internal using.

## Contributors

HierarchicalKV is co-maintianed by [NVIDIA Merlin Team](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin) and NVIDIA product end-users,
and also open for public contributions, bug fixes, and documentation. [[Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)]

## How to build

Basically, HierarchicalKV is a headers only library, the commands below only create binaries for benchmark and unit testing.

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/HierarchicalKV.git
cd HierarchicalKV && mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Dsm=80 .. && make -j
```

For Benchmark:
```shell
./merlin_hashtable_benchmark
```

For Unit Test:
```shell
./merlin_hashtable_test
```

Your environment must meet the following requirements:

- CUDA version >= 11.2
- NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 8.0, 8.6, 8.7 or 9.0


## Benchmark

* GPU: 1 x NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB: 8.0
* Key Type = uint64_t
* Value Type = float32 * {dim}
* Key-Values per OP = 1,048,576
* ***Throughput Unit: Billion-KV/second***
